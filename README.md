# Signlanguage_translation_fingerspelling-audio

This project presents an innovative solution for Sign Language Translation (SLT) into
text and audio, sought to close the communication gap that exists between the hearing and the
deaf communities.. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and modern
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system offers a real-time, accurate, and inclusive
communication experience. The proposed algorithm utilizes CNNs for robust hand gesture
recognition and landmark detection, capitalizing on the potential of the Media pipe library.
Sign language gestures are interpreted, converted into textual information, displayed as
subtitles, and generated as corresponding audio output, providing comprehensive translation
services in multilingual environments. Deep learning ensures adaptability to various sign
language dialects and enhances learning capabilities over time. Implemented in Python, with
Tensor Flow as the backbone for the CNN model, the system integrates Flask for seamless
communication between the backend and frontend, ensuring a user-friendly interface
prioritizing accessibility. HTML and CSS are employed for software integration into devices
compared to traditional web applications. The translation model demonstrates proficiency in
handling complex sign language expressions, particularly in American Sign Language (ASL),
facilitating effective communication for the hearing-impaired with the broader world.
